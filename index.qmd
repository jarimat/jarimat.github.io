Hey! My name's Jake, and I'm a Junior in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability! I'm in the Honors Track, and I'm also a re-founding father for the Epsilon Kappa chapter of Beta Theta Pi. I am fascinated with environmental history, ecology, and conservation, and want to pursue a federal- or state-level job in a position pertaining to those fields in Colorado once I graduate.
